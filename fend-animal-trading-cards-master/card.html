		    <p>Rabbits are herbivores that feed by grazing on grass, forbs, and leafy weeds. In consequence, their diet contains large amounts of cellulose, which is hard to digest. Rabbits solve this problem via a form of hindgut fermentation. They pass two distinct types of feces: hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are known as caecotrophs and are immediately eaten (a behaviour known as coprophagy). Rabbits reingest their own droppings (rather than chewing the cud as do cows and numerous other herbivores) to digest their food further and extract sufficient nutrients.</p>

			   <p>Rabbits and hares are “lagomorphs”, an order that also includes the pika, a small burrowing mammal that looks like a large mouse and lives in colder climates.</p>

				<p>Rabbits are meticulously clean animals and are easy to house break and train.  Much like a dog, a pet rabbit can be taught to come to his/her name, sit in your lap, and do simple tricks.</p>

<p>Happy rabbits practice a cute behavior known as a “binky:” they jump up in the air and twist and spin around! A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe, and a male is a buck.  A group of rabbits is called a herd.

Rabbits are herbivores, eating a diet entirely of grasses and other plants.  Because their diet contains so much cellulose, they pass two different kinds of feces to completely break down their food.  While other grazers will chew and swallow their feed, then “burp” it back up (as cows chew cud), rabbits will re-ingest their feces on the first pass to get all of the nutrients they need.

The average size of a rabbit litter is usually between 4 and 12 babies, which results after a short 30-day gestation.  Male rabbits can reproduce as early as 7 months of age, and females as early as 4 months.  This means in one year a single female rabbit can produce as many as 800 children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren!

A rabbit’s life span is about 8 years, though sterilized rabbits (those who are spayed/neutered) can live as long as 10-12 years.</p>
